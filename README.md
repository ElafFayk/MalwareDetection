# Recealer Malware Detection

Welcome to the Recealer Malware Detection Project repository! This project leverages advanced techniques in Machine and Deep Learning Models to identify whether a specific executable file in Windows is a raccoon stealer malware (one the most common info-stealer malware nowadays) or benign, helping to enhance cybersecurity efforts. 


## Features

- Take advantage of both dynamic and static features of the malware. 
- utilize the properties of both ML for faster detection and DL for precise results.
- Take appropriateÂ actionÂ ifÂ theÂ fileÂ is malwareÂ (deletingÂ theÂ file).
- Provide a brief report after handling the file.



## Basic Overview

ThisÂ isÂ theÂ workflowÂ of the modelÂ theÂ file will go to the ML model first, then the DL model if there is uncertainty about the classification.

## Deployment

To deploy this project successfully, you need to install several programs:

1- Hypervisors Tools like VirtualBox or VMware Workstation are required to install Cuckoo sandbox as a guest vm, also to setup windows vm to test the model.

2- Cuckoo Sandbox
This is used for analyzing malware and benign files, providing a secure and isolated environment for testing.

3- Python IDEs PyCharm or Spyder are recommended for running the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Python source codes efficiently.
